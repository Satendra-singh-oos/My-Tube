## üêû BUG

- Some State Related Issue

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

#### Description

After posting a tweet or comment, the data fetched from the backend is not displaying correctly due to state management issues:

- Comments are displaying "NAN" instead of the expected data, despite receiving valid data from the backend.
- Tweets fail to update the associated image in the UI, even though the Redux state is updated correctly. However, upon reloading the page, the data appears as expected.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Log in to the MyTube platform.
2. Navigate to the tweet or comment section.
3. Post a new tweet or comment.
4. Observe the displayed data for the posted tweet or comment.

#### Expected Behavior

After posting a tweet or comment, the displayed data should accurately reflect the content posted, including any associated images, without requiring a page reload.

#### Actual Behavior

- Comments display "NAN" instead of the expected data, indicating a state management issue.
- Tweets fail to update the associated image in the UI, suggesting a disconnect between the Redux state and the UI rendering. However, the data appears correctly after reloading the page.

#### Additional Information

- This issue was observed on both desktop and mobile devices.
- No error messages are displayed to indicate the problem.
- Redux DevTools show that the state is updated correctly after posting a tweet or comment.
